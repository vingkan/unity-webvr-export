## Unity Compatibility

These assets work with Unity versions `2017.3.0` and above.

### Browser Compatibility

| Platform | Browser | Compatible headsets | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | Firefox | HTC VIVE, Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality headsets (using Steam VR) | [Setup instructions](https://webvr.rocks/firefox) |
| Desktop | Microsoft Edge | Windows Mixed Reality headsets | [Setup instructions](https://webvr.rocks/microsoft_edge) |
| Desktop | Chrome Canary | HTC VIVE, Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality headsets | Browser flags required. [Setup instructions](https://webvr.rocks/chrome) |

### Polyfilled WebVR

If the user does not have supported headset, browser or device, the content will still work through the use of the [WebVR Polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webvr-polyfill).

### Mobile support

This asset works by utilizing Unity's WebGL platform support and therefore shares the same limitations. Because of this, mobile support is limited and may not work. See [Unity's WebGL browser compatibility](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/Manual/webgl-browsercompatibility.html).

## Developer Privacy Notice for Data Collection

_Last updated: March 2018_

To help improve the [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/) and the [Unity WebVR Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/webvr-assets-109152) package, each time a web page built using the [WebVR Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/webvr-assets-109152) is loaded, Mozilla automatically receives general-usage statistics and uncaught JavaScript errors encountered by end-users, using [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) and [Sentry](https://sentry.io), respectively. [The *complete list of collected data*](https://github.com/mozilla/unity-webvr-export/blob/master/TELEMETRY.md#list-of-collected-data) includes metrics for counting the number of unique web-page sessions; time for web pages to load and time open; JavaScript error exceptions occurred on the page; the number of times a VR device is mounted and worn; number of times VR mode is enabled and time spent; and a random identifier.

You as a developer can turn off this data collection by [modifying the configuration snippet that comes with the VR template](https://github.com/mozilla/unity-webvr-export/blob/master/docs/customization/disabling-telemetry.md). It is your obligation to inform your end-users of this data collection and to inform them that it can be turned off by [enabling “Do-Not-Track”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/DNT) in their browsers.


## Credits

This project was heavily influenced by early explorations in using Unity to build for WebVR by [@gtk2k](https://github.com/gtk2k) and [Chris Miller (@chrmi)](https://github.com/chrmi).

Also, thanks to [Arturo Paracuellos (@arturitu)](https://github.com/arturitu) for creating the [3D-hand models](https://github.com/aframevr/assets/tree/gh-pages/controllers/hands) used for controllers in these examples.
